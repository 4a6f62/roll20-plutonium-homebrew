# Plutonium Homebrew Import

Converted from Roll20 export: 4a6f62 FF

## Contents
- **80 Monsters/NPCs** with full stat blocks

## How to Import into Foundry VTT via Plutonium

1. **Copy the files:**
   - Copy `homebrew.json` and the `images/` folder to a location accessible by your Foundry server
   - Or host them on a web server / GitHub

2. **Import via Plutonium:**
   - In Foundry VTT, open the **Plutonium Import** tool
   - Click on **"Import from URL"** or **"Import from File"**
   - If using URL: provide the URL to `homebrew.json`
   - If using file: select the `homebrew.json` file
   - Click **"Import"**

3. **Alternative - Manual URL setup:**
   - Go to Plutonium settings
   - Add custom homebrew repository
   - Point to the URL where you hosted `homebrew.json`

## File Structure
- `homebrew.json` - 5eTools homebrew format data
- `images/` - Token images for monsters/NPCs

## Notes
- This follows the 5eTools homebrew JSON schema
- All statblocks are preserved from Roll20
- Token images are included and referenced in the JSON
- Player characters were excluded from this export
- You can combine this with other homebrew by merging the "monster" arrays

## Troubleshooting
- If images don't load, make sure the `images/` folder is in the same directory as `homebrew.json`
- Or update the `tokenUrl` paths in the JSON to point to your image hosting location
